        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Nanda Krishna, a dedicated mathematics student currently pursuing my Master's degree. My primary interests lie in partial differential equations (PDEs), mathematical modeling, and game theory. I am currently working on my Master's thesis, focusing on the mathematical modeling of tumor invasion using PDEs and game theory, under the guidance of Dr. Sourav Kumar Sasmal at IIT Roorkee.
    <p>In addition to my thesis work, I have experience in cryptography and enjoy coding and web development. I believe these fields offer incredible potential to solve real-world problems and make a positive impact..</p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mathematical Modeling of Tumor Invasion</strong>(Ongoing): Using PDE and game theory to study tumor growth and invasion patterns.</li>
            <li><strong>Study of Boolean Functions</strong>: Research project under Dr.Bimal Mandal, Department of Mathematics, IIT Jodhpur where I used Python to construct a code that finds the maximum nonlinearity values of different classes of 
Boolean functions of n variables. </li>
            <li><strong>Software for storing and editing data in hospitals using C++</strong>: Developed software in C++ that stores data of patients in a hospital  </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Mathematics: Knowledge in PDEs , mathematical modeling, cryptography, and game theory .</li>
            <li>Programming: Proficient in Python, C++ and MATLAB with experience in data analysis and web development.</li>
            <li>Research: Strong analytical and problem-solving skills, with the ability to conduct independent research.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
        <p>Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy a variety of activities to relax and stay active. I love reading books on a wide range of topics, from fiction to non-fiction. Exercise is an essential part of my routine, and I often find myself going for evening runs or working out at the gym.I enjoy participating trivia and quiz competitions.Owing to this, I have served as the club coordinator of Shemushi, the Quiz CLubof IISER Tirupati</p>
